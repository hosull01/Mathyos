Mathyos - Global Energy Solutions 
Harry O'Sullivan 

This summer, I helped develop/design a website for my father's new energy 
consulting start-up. Using different templates and widits offered online, 
I tried to create an asthetically pleasing and functional interface. Three
of the four photos on the 'Home' screen were taken from the screen saver 
options on Mac OSX.
